## 🏛️ Project Architecture

The Nemesis - Geolocation, Routes and Tracking have a unacoplated hexagonal - clean architecture where looks for isolate the business logic with the other part of the app dividing it in multiple components:

* **🧠 Domain (Core)**: Contains the business logic and principal rules.

* **🎯 Ports (Interfaces)**: Are interfaces that define the actions that the domain can do.

* **🔌 Adapters (Infrastructure)**: Are the implementations of the ports that connect the domain with the specific technologies. 

The use of this architecture has the following benefits:

* ✅ **Separation of Concerns:** Distinct boundaries between logic and infrastructure.
* ✅ **Maintainability:** Easier to update or replace specific components.
* ✅ **Scalability:** Components can evolve independently.
* ✅ **Testability:** The domain can be tested in isolation without a database or server.

# 📐 System Architecture & Design

This section provides a visual representation of the module's architecture ilustrating the base diagrams to show the application structure and components flow.


### 🧩 Context Diagram

Text

![Context Diagram](./docs/diagramaContexto.png)

### 🧩 Specific Components Diagram
---
This diagram visualizes the dependencies between classes for developing the module's logic. It includes the following components:

* Controllers:
    * Geolocalization Controller: This controller receives and manages all requests related to geolocation management, routes, and tracking, including references handled via DTOs.

When applying a hexagonal architecture, before developing the use cases, we need adapter components:

* Adapter:

    * Geolocalization Adapter: Contracts (interfaces) are defined based on the input received from the controllers.

    * Mapper Adapter: This adapter transforms data types from one object to another for use in the respective use cases.

* Use Cases:

    * Get Emergency Contacts Use Case: Implementation to allow passengers to share their location with emergency contacts.

    * Get Geolocation Information Use Case: Obtain position information at regular intervals.

    * Generate Automatic Alerts Use Case: Generate automatic alerts at the beginning and end of the trip.

* Ports: The following interfaces were defined as the data we will receive from the outside:

    * Port Notifications

    * Port Profiles

    * Port Travel Information

### 🧩 Use Cases Diagram
---
This diagram presents the main functionalities defined by each actor. This facilitates a better understanding when implementing the module's multiple functions, as well as identifying and separating each actor's roles when using the application.

![Use Cases Diagram](./docs/diagramaCasosUso.png)

### 🧩 Class Diagram
---
Based on the Specific Components diagram, we created the class diagram, where we defined an Observer design pattern that will notify all passengers already registered on the trip, allowing them to view the current location at certain intervals, and all the information about the estimated route, the distance traveled, and so on.

![Class Diagram](./docs/diagramaClases.png)

### 🧩 Data Base Diagram
---

This diagram represents how the data is stored, where we will find the multiple documents, and the data that will be stored in an embedded or referenced manner.

![Data Base Diagram](./docs/diagramaDeBasesDeDatos.png)


### 🧩 Sequence Diagrams
---
This diagram presents the complete CRUD workflow for trip geolocation. It includes sequence diagrams for initiating, updating, and ending a trip.

The diagram also details the required validations and potential errors that may occur in each functionality. Finally, it illustrates the components involved in each process, including the Google Maps API and the relationship between them.
